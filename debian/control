Description: SELinux core policy utilities
 Security-enhanced Linux is a patch of the Linux速 kernel and a number
 of utilities with enhanced security functionality designed to add
 mandatory access controls to Linux.  The Security-enhanced Linux
 kernel contains new architectural components originally developed to
 improve the security of the Flask operating system. These
 architectural components provide general support for the enforcement
 of many kinds of mandatory access control policies, including those
 based on the concepts of Type Enforcement速, Role-based Access Control,
 and Multi-level Security.
 .
 This package contains the core policy utilities that are required
 for basic operation of an SELinux system.  These utilities include
 load_policy to load policies, setfiles to label filesystems.

 RBAC/MLS policy machines require newrole as a way of changing the role or
 level of a logged in user.
 .
 This package contains newrole to switch roles, run_init to run /etc/init.d
 scripts in the proper context.
